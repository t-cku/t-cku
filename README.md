# 👋 Hi, I'm Tiffany (t-cku)

I'm a Computer Engineering & Computer Science student at the University of Southern California who loves solving interdisciplinary problems — especially where **data, strategy, and product design** meet. I enjoy building things that are both **analytically rigorous** and **intuitively designed**, whether that’s a predictive model, a clean interface, or a system that makes complex information easier to act on.

I'm especially interested in **equities, quantitative finance, product development/management, and software engineering** — essentially, anywhere I can combine **technical depth with thoughtful decision-making**.
